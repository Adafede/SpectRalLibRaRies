This package provides spectral libraries in R.

⚠️ This repository is not maintained and will not be except for extreme interest.
It has just been opened for the sake of transparency.

For now, the version of MassBank used and the Zenodo repository IDs are added manually to the file names.
This might change in the future.

Also look at <https://github.com/taxonomicallyinformedannotation/tima-isdb-pos> and <https://github.com/taxonomicallyinformedannotation/tima-isdb-neg>
